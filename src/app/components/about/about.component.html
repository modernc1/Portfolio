    <h2>Who am I</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer with a background in physical therapy.
      For the past two years, I have been learning and building modern, practical web applications
      using <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> for the backend and <strong>Angular</strong> for the frontend.
      I enjoy turning ideas into real, working products that are clean, fast, and user-friendly.
      I focus on writing organized, maintainable code and following clean architecture principles
      to ensure my projects are scalable and reliable.
      Whether it's a blog, an online store, or a real estate website—I always aim to create
      solutions that run smoothly and deliver real value.
